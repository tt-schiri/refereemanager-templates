## Git-Repository

Short information about the structure of the git repository:

The branches are constructed regarding the git branching model of http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

This means, there are always at least three branches:

1. `master` - contains released versions
2. `develop` - main synchronisation branch for feature, release, and hotfix branches
3. `feature/work` - main working branch for development

Additionally, the following branches may occur:

- `feature/*` - writing a special feature
- `release/*` - synchronizing release versions between `develop` and `master`
- `hotfix/*` - fast bugfixes
